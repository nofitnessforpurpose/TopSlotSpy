  All the files are required.  <br>
  The default repository format for 3D files is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. 
<br>  
  The default repository format for PCB files is <a targer="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format">GERBER</a> .
<br>

<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kicad.org/" >KiCad </a> may prove suitable for viewing GERBER files.
